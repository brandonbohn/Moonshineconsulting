 What you need to do before you die!
People go through their life not even considering their death. I have recently looked back in my life and realized I believe I will be with Jesus when I die. I have a couple of things that I needed to do. Did you know that in Missouri they just increased the look back period before you go into a nursing home. What does this mean. It means that if your finances are not in a trust 7 years before you go into a nursing home. Medicaid can take that home and property. They will sell it to pay for your being in a nursing home.  Unfortunately, most Americans work all our lives and want to leave what we have to our children.  We do not know that if we go into a nursing home that the property will be sold for our care.  Check your local state government laws to confirm this. You need to go to an attorney to get a will and a trust.   Along with these items. You need to consider what you want done if you cannot make decisions for yourself. What happens if a husband and wife get into a car wreck. Who will make the decisions if both of you cannot make your own decisions? A durable power of attorney for finances and one for healthcare decision needs to be drawn up. Please come back and I will be writing about some other things to do before you die!


What You Need to Do Before You Die: A Senior’s Essential Checklist

Most of us go through life without giving much thought to what happens when we’re gone. But as I’ve taken time to reflect, I’ve come to believe that I will be with Jesus when I die—and that brings me peace. Still, there are important things I realized I needed to take care of while I’m still here.

Here’s the truth: Many Americans work hard their entire lives, hoping to leave something behind for their children. What most don’t know is that—without proper planning—the home and property you’ve worked so hard for can be taken to pay for nursing home care.

A Warning from Missouri (Check Your State Too!)

Did you know that Missouri recently increased the Medicaid look-back period to seven years? That means if your assets aren’t protected in a trust at least seven years before entering a nursing home, the state can reclaim your home and other assets to cover your care costs.

This is a wake-up call for many families. You must take steps now if you want to preserve your legacy.
