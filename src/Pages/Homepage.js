<p className='bubble' >  Like you my mother has worked hard all her life and has gave her all to everybody including her family.  My mom is a very loving, caring lifelong nurse that will do anything for people 
              and of course spend money on me.   However, last month my mom finally found a way to retire comfortably and enjoy her golden years.
                She also found selfworth and a new passion and lease on life.  How did she do it you ask?  She learned at the button that says learn.
                 This button made  her life better and  helped her develop her selfworth and confidence. 
                  Now you can too by clicking the buttons below.   Uh oh. Her comes Mom I had better go before I get into trouble and get grounded from my doggy treats!  </p>
