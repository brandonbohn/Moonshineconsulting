 Woof, My Name is Moonshine. Mom is in the other room, and she is working as always.  Since My Mother is busy, I wanted to share my tale of how I put a smile on my mom’s patients’ face and learned about senior care.  It started about a year and a half ago when Mom took me to some training to be a service dog.  However, I got scared and it did not work out!  She started taking me into the nursing home where she works.  Not to brag or anything but I was a hit. Most people there were very nice.  I got lots of love from the residents. They all wanted to hold me and give me treats. In turn, I made them smile.  Sometimes it was sad because some of them acted a little different and yelled a lot and that scared me. Mom said it was because they had dementia or Alzheimer’s and could not remember things. I still do not know what those big names mean but Mom reassured me and that we would get some more treats if I continued to go and make the residents smile. 
There was one lady that asked Mom if I could live with her. She said she loved dogs, and I was so adorable she wanted to keep me in the nursing home! Mom explained to her that I had a brother and sister that needed me to come home but promised we would come back to visit!  Sometimes Mom would make me heal and do tricks for the residents. They all clapped and wanted me to come back. 
Gotta run here comes mom. I will give more information about my experiences visiting the folks in the nursing home and tell you about other things that other dogs and cats are doing to help folks. They need us dogs to visit them. We do have to behave and have the one thing I hate shots Yikes! Bye for now. Love Moonshine
